It was one night ago
(just the night before)
I heard someone outside
knocking on my door.
I looked through the window
and what did I see... ?

A green scaly dragon

looking back at me !

He

He had found me again,
but how I can’t say.
does even though I run away.

But I couldn’t let him touch me,
not one hair from my head,
so like any boy would ...

id under my bed !
h
I
...
Trembling I crouched
resembling live bait,
tortured with fear
regretting the wait.
Then suddenly I heard it-the sound rang out true...

...Of the door crashing down
and the dragon coming through !

He checked several rooms.
He could have checked more,

but instead he stopped
outside my bedroom door.

I could hear his scales rubbing
as the dragon passed through
and smelled his breath stinking
like a burnt rubber shoe.
He was close and I knew it,
but where could I go?

...With the bed up above
and the floor down below ?

I kept
really still
and I held my breath tight,
wondering what
my fate held that night.
He knew that he had me,
I just know that he did,
as he checked all the places he
thought I had hid.

He looked in the closet
behind my old coats.

He checked all my shelves
and underneath my toy boats.

He wouldn’t stop looking
and I quivered with dread,
as the dragon came close
and stopped at my bed.

t could I do
a
h
W

with the dragon so near?
Anticipating the moment
his head would appear.
Then something peeked under,
but it was only his toe
and the dragon sat down
knowing I was below.

It was quiet for a moment,
but that didn’t last,
my bed started squeaking
and shaking really fast.

I wondered what was happening,
so I stuck out my head
and was surprised to see the dragon
jumping on my bed.

He jumped up and down
‘till it started to break.
Then sure enough,
he jumped
with one final
hard take.

The mattress

snapped in half
when he landed on my bed.

giggled with delight
as it landed on my head.

And he

I felt sure I was trapped
when I first looked around,
crushed beneath my mattress
and dust bunnies on the ground.
But no crying just yet, though I had no place to go.

Instead of lying still, I wiggled to and fro.

I was finding more room
and soon able to crawl,
the dragon never noticed
‘till he felt the mattress fall.

He was mad and I knew it,
as he saw me
run away,

breathing
purple
smoke puffs
in a vicious sort of way.
So I dashed through the kitchen
heading for the door...
the dragon’s hot breath getting hard
to ignore.

Just then I made it.
I opened the door wide,
heading out doors
leaving the dragon inside.
But since he thought
he could make it,
he let out a roar.
Then the dragon
charged forward
crushing his nose
in the door.

I know I should have ran
and found a new place to hide,
though the dragon started wailing
loudly as he cried.
But how could I run while holding my ears...

or leave the
poor dragon

drowning
in tears ?

That’s why I stopped, just to help the dragon out.
I thought I could help
and wrap his wounded snout.

But did I get a “Thank-you!”
or did he say “How sweet!“
Or did he just stare at me
like something good to eat ?

Oh, he smiled at me
as best as he could:
Like no respectable dragon
ever should.

With one hand, he reached out
and touched me on my side.
With the other, he wiped the fake tears
that he cried.

The moment it happened,
I threw the biggest fit!
I screamed myself hoarse
when the dragon yelled...

“

TAG!

NOW YOU’RE IT!”
